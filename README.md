# Luna4s in Invisible, Inc.

This mod adds the character the streamer [Luna4s](https://www.twitch.tv/luna4s) as a playable agent in the game [*Invisible, Inc.* by Klei Entertainment](https://store.steampowered.com/app/243970/Invisible_Inc/). 

## Installation

You can download the most recent full build of the mod from the [Releases](https://github.com/Mobbstar/InvisibleInc-Luna4s/releases), and unzip it into your Mods folder. Each change also produces a build that you can download from the [Action](https://github.com/Mobbstar/InvisibleInc-MoreMissions/actions), but it might not have been tested in-game yet.

If you download the source files directly, make sure to compile them:
- scripts.zip - Simply but all the contents of the "scripts" directory directly into a zip file with the same name.
- KWAD files - Run the KWAD builder to generate a fresh KWAD file from the raw assets in this repository. View the official modding tutorials for more information.

This mod requires [Sim Constructor by Cyberboy2000](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=580661011).
